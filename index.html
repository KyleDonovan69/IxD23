    Introduction 

Welcome to the introduction of my interaction design project, focused on gamifying a learning app.<br> Our aim is to make the learning experience more engaging and interactive for our users.<br>
 
    Gamification involves applying game design principles to non-game contexts, such as education.<br> The objective is to increase user motivation, engagement, and enjoyment.<br> 

    This project involved various phases, including a competitive analysis, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing.<br> The competitive analysis will helped me identify strengths and weaknesses in the existing market, and highlight areas we can improve.<br>

    Wireframing and prototyping allowed us to design and develop the interface and user experience of the app, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable learning process.<br>

    Finally, usability testing was conducted to gather feedback from users on the app's usability and functionality.<br> The feedback will be used to refine and improve the app, ensuring that the user's needs are met.<br>

    Overall, our aim is to create a learning app that is not only effective but also enjoyable, ultimately improving the user's learning outcomes.</h3>
